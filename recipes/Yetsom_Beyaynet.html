    <p><strong>Yetsom Beyaynet (Vegetarian Combination Platter)</strong></p>
    <img src="../images/Yetsom_Beyaynet.jpg" width="808" height = "800" alt="Yetsom_Beyaynet">
    <p>the vegetarian combination platter. It’s made up of a mix of vegan curries and vegetables served on a plate of injera. Yetsom means fasting and beyaynetu means combination platter. In principle, the combination platter is very similar in composition, but not flavor, to an Indian thali. <br>
        It consists of the following stews and curries:
    </p>

    <p><strong>Shiro Wat</strong><br>
        A spicy chickpea powder-based dish seasoned with onions, garlic, and other spices.</p>
        <p>
            1-2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
            ½ onion, chopped<br>
            4 cloves garlic, minced<br>
            4-5 cups water, or more<br>
            ½ cup <em>shiro</em>
        </p>
        <p>Saute onions until translucent, add garlic. Add 4 cups water and bring to a boil. Add shiro powder, whisk until dissolved. Cook for 35-45 minutes, adding more boiled water to thin the consistency, if necessary. The consistency should not be sticky of clumpy. </p>
        <p><strong>Miser Wat (Spiced Red Lentils)<br>
        </strong><em> delicious combination of split red lentils simmered in spicy berbere sauce Depending on the ingredients, it can sometimes be darker.<br>
        </em><br>
        1-2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
        1 onion, diced<br>
        2 teaspoons – 1 tablespoon or more <em>berbere<br>
        </em>4-5 cloves garlic, crushed<br>
        1 cup red lentils, rinsed and drained<br>
        3-4 cups water<br>
        salt</p>
        <p>Heat oil in a sauce pan and sauté onions until translucent. Add <em>berbere</em> and stir until well coated. Add garlic and cook until flavors have melded, about 5 minutes. Add a little water to blend, then add lentils and stir until well coated. Add&nbsp;½ teaspoon salt and 3 cups of water. Cook until lentils have broken apart, adding more water if necessary. The consistency should be like a thick stew. Taste and adjust for salt.</p>
        <p><em>Note: Berbere </em> gives the red lentils the spice and a deep red color. If you can take heat, try a full tablespoon, else start with 2 teaspoons and slowly add more to suit your taste. I only used two teaspoons for a larger audience to eat it, but I would have liked it with more. I like spicy!</p>
        <p><strong>Kik Alicha (Yellow Split Pea Stew)<br>
        </strong><em>This&nbsp;split pea stew is&nbsp;often cooked with a light turmeric sauce. There are different kinds of alichas (and ways to spell it in English). It often depends on the exact spices and consistency of the lentils and sauce. </em></p>

        <p><strong>Key Sire Alicha (Beets, Potatoes and Carrots Stew)<br />
        </strong><em>This simple stew gets a tangy kick from the addition of lemon juice or vinegar. Sometimes the beets can be marinated for a very tangy stew, but here they&#8217;re not.</em></p>
        <p>1-2 tablespoons olive oil<br />
        ½ onion, sliced in 2-inch strips<br />

        green chile pepper, sliced (optional)</p>
        <p>Heat oil in a saucepan, add onions and sauté until fragrant, add garlic and stir until fragrant. Add beets, potatoes and carrots, stir until slightly softened. Add vinegar or lemon juice, turmeric and stir until well coated. Add a little water and salt and cook until potatoes and carrots are softened (cooked). Taste and adjust seasoning.</p>
        
        <p><strong><em>Notes:</em> </strong>As mentioned above, the six dishes I cooked are just a sampling of Ethiopian vegan/vegetarian dishes. If tomatoes were in season right now, I would have added a nice tomato salad that is often added to this type of combination platter.</p>
        <p>Many Ethiopians cook with vegetable or canola oil. I choose to use olive oil. I also chose to reduce the amount of oil that&#8217;s often used to cook these dishes.</p>
