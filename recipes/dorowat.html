    <h2>Recipe ingredients</h2>

        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>tomato paste</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>onions</li>
        <li>lemon</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Berbere spice</li>
        <li>Dried Basil</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's explain what each ingredient is used for.</p>
    <ol >
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong> â€“ Traditionally, a whole chicken cut into 12 pieces is used in this Ethiopian dish to represent the 12 tribes of Jacob (from the Bible). But feel free to use any cut of chicken you prefer. ðŸ˜‰</li>
        <li><strong>Aromatics</strong> â€“ Take your time sauteing the onion, garlic, ginger, and the unique blend of spices from the <strong>Ethiopian spiced butter</strong>. This allows them to fully release their delectable savory goodness that will indeed reflect our sauce base. Yum!</li>
        <li><strong>Boiled Eggs</strong> â€“ You canâ€™t go wrong with adding more protein. Let them simmer with the sauce for a more effective flavor absorption.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato Paste </strong>â€“ Besides adding a rich tanginess, it also adds a lovely deep reddish hue to our spicy chicken stew.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong> â€“ <strong>Berbere spice </strong>is the key ingredient in this recipe. It holds different flavors from a diverse blend of spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, fenugreek, cardamom, and cumin, giving our stew its authentic taste. I also added more paprika and basil to deepen the flavor.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon </strong>â€“ The lemon juice somewhat gives our dish a refreshing zing and balances the fat in the spiced butter.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
